                        Heh~ I am a silly robot created by Tiny Jasmini (JasminDreasond) and Splitter was responsible for designing the engineering of my final design.
                        Do not be afraid. I don't bite, I won't hurt you. But you could end up being my lunch with your car. *giggles*

                        <br/><br/>

                        Tiny Jasmini is very silly. She wrote my script while eating puddings and ended up writing a pudding in my script, and that ended up bringing me to life the way I am today. How silly she is~
                        I'm also silly, intelligent. I am an  adorable giant robot pony~

                        Hihi... Don't think I only eat cars, I love cupcakes too.
